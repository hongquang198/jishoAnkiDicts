    # Flutter Tensorflow Lite Jisho dictionary + Ankidroid
Japanese Dictionary with Handwriting recognition using Tensorflow Lite and ETL models, jisho API
(It works on both Android and iOS.)

UI inspired by https://www.behance.net/gallery/96147213/Dictionary-app-design-concept

Since Jisho.org doesn't have a mobile application version, and most of the dictionary apps look like they're made from 2005, moreover in order to support my Vietnamese community with the latest smart features, I decided to try my best to create one using Flutter and integrated it with some basic Anki functionalities.

In short, the app aims to combine Anki with a smart dictionary to completely remove the time-consuming input process to create flashcard as fast as possible, with ample word information like pitch accent, example sentences, and a lot more!

Main functionality:
- Dark mode, beautiful UI, inspired by a great designer I came across on https://www.behance.net/gallery/96147213/Dictionary-app-design-concept
- Pitch accent dictionary was taken from Wadoku dictionary with more than 111.000 entries.
- View times on each words to help you decide whether they are worth learning.
- Fast look up using application floating icon (like facebook messenger) with the ability to look up from clipboard
- Configurable spaced-repetition system.
- Offline handwriting recognition.
- Example sentences taken from tatoeba.org: > 200.000 entries.
- Basic grammar look up with corresponding JLPT level.
- Kanji dictionary was based off of a RTK kanji deck with top 2 most upvoted stories on kanji.koohii.com: 2200 entries.
- Supports Vietnamese and English language.
- No ads. This is a completely free, open-source application and I intend to not include ads in the future
